I'm sharing the exercise, I attached some screenshots of the result.

Developed with .NET MAUI. I will create it with React Native too but this is out of the scope.

NOTE: I modified the class to make the DI implementation and the UT.

I'm using Shell, Mopup, SyncFusion and The49, with the CommunityToolit packages.

There are some ways to implement the set the BindingContext:
// 1.- Creating and Interface
// 2.- Create a custom Navigation to pass that ViewModel integrated with Shell
// 4.- Using a IServiceProvider.
// 3.- Injecting the ViewModel in the constructor directly.
